# 3D Printing Settings Database

Welcome to the 3D Printing Settings Database project! This project aims to gather and share a collection of configuration presets for use with PrusaSlicer, a popular 3D printing software. These predefined settings will streamline the printing process by providing tested configurations for various scenarios.
